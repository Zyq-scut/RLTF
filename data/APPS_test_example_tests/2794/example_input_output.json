{"inputs": ["You have $4$ coworkers and you need to ask for help $4$ times. Initially, their annoyance levels are $a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=3, a_4=4$, the increases are $d_1=2, d_2=3, d_3=4, d_4=5$. One optimal solution is to ask for help twice from coworker $1$, once from coworker $2$, and once from coworker $3$, in which case the final annoyance levels are: $a_1=1 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 5, a_2=2 + 3 = 5, a_3=3 + 4 = 7, a_4=4$. The coworker that is most annoyed at you is coworker $3$, whose annoyance level at you is $7$. Or, you could ask coworker $1$ for help $3$ times and coworker $2$ once, leaving you with $a_1=1 + 3 \\cdot 2 = 7, a_2=2 + 3 = 5, a_3=3, a_4=4$. Both strategies yield the same minimal maximum amount.\n4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n", "3 2\n1 1000\n1000 1\n"], "outputs": ["7\n", "1002"]}
